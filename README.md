# Node Express Last.fm API
## Abstract
This project provides a simple Node.js REST API application to forward API calls to the Last.fm API. It utilizes its `search.artist` method. The user provides a search string, which is responded by the Last.fm API's search result. The user then has the possibility to let the Node server write and save the received search result as a CSV file in a given data format.

The request to build this application was given as a coding challenge for a job interview.
### Requirements
- [x] Search for an artist by name based on the following endpoint artist.search, return all the
results for this artist.
- [x] Writes the result to a user-supplied CSV filename.
- [x] The CSV file should include the following information (name, mbid, url, image_small,
image)
- [x] â‡’ If no results returned from the artist.search endpoint, retrieve random artist names from a JSON dictionary source file for example:
`[â€˜artistName1â€™, â€˜artistName2â€™, â€˜artistName3â€™]`
- [x] Repeat as necessary until you have gathered a list of artists.
